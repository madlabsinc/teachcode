All the best...\n\n * A Dart script needs the main() method for execution.\n\n\tFor example: \n\n\t void main() {\n\n\t print('Hello World');\n\n\t} \n\n * The main() function is a predefined method in Dart. \n * This method acts as the entry point to the application.\n\n Task 1:-\n Print Hello World to the console using the pre-built print function.
